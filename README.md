```

## Features

- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- Web-based dashboard interface for webhook management

## System Requirements

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- Supported platforms:
  - Windows

  - Linux (x64 and ARM64)

## Usage

You can run the CLI directly using `npx` without installation:

```bash
npx shopify-webhooks-dashboard --store <store> --api-key <api-key>
```

### Required Flags:

- `--store`: Your Shopify store domain (e.g., mystore.myshopify.com)
- `--api-key`: Your Shopify Admin API access token

### API Access Token Configuration

Your Shopify Admin API access token needs to have access to the resource you want to create webhooks for. For example:

- To create a webhook for products, you need `read_products`
- To create a webhook for orders, you need `read_orders`
- To create a webhook for customers, you need `read_customers`

To get an access token with the required scopes:

1. Go to your Shopify admin panel
2. Navigate to Settings > Apps and sales channels
3. Click on "Develop apps"
4. Create a new app or select an existing one
5. Configure the required scopes for your webhooks under "Configuration"
6. Install the app in your store
7. Get the Admin API access token from the app settings

Example:

```bash
npx shopify-webhooks-dashboard --store mystore.myshopify.com --api-key shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

When you run the command with the required flags, the CLI will:

1. Start a local server on port 3000
2. Automatically open your default web browser to the dashboard
3. Allow you to manage your Shopify webhooks through the web interface

### Notes:

- The API key should be an Admin API access token from your Shopify store
- The dashboard uses Shopify's Admin API version 2024-10
- All webhook management operations (create, list, delete) are performed through the web interface
